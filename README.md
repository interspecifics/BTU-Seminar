# BEYOND SONIFICATION: A DATA-DRIVEN MACHINE LEARNING COMPOSITION APPROACH 
Edgar Var√©se - Guest Professorship. 
BTU - SEMINAR

We will explore a contemporary technique for generative sound, which involves incoming data and machine learning as a form of sound influence. We will use a set of open-source pattern-recognition applications developed by our collective to cluster and map data streams as sound event triggers and modulators in a synthesis generator of choice.
Each of the practical sessions is presented in a workshop format, where we will share the technology and developments of some of our most representative projects.
